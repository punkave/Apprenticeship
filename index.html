        <h3>Why are we doing it?</h3>
        <p>
          The team at P'unk Avenue has a sustained interest in creating value by training creative professionals in both purposefulness and technical skills.
          As individuals, we are continually pursuing not only mastery of our technical vocations but also development of ourselves, and this holistic approach to life and work drives us to educate others.
          With respect to the technical aspects of the apprenticeship, our team crosses many of the traditional boundaries of creative disciplines. We therefore have an interest in training professionals to adapt and thrive in a variety of roles within the field.
